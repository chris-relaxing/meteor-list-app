This app is a list that allows my wife and I to separately sign in and add grocery shopping items to a combined list. She can view the list on her phone as she is shopping and whenever an item is added to the cart she can check it off and it can disappear from the list. It also shows how many items are remaining in the list.

This app can be seen on my website here:<BR>
